## Well <i>hello</i> world!
My name is Tyler and I am a software developer. I do 
<a href="https://twit96.github.io/"><b>front-end web development</b></a>, 
and love tinkering with CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

#### Speaking of JavaScript,
I have experience with the Phaser 3 JavaScript framework, with which I have developed 
<a href="https://github.com/twit96/PharaohsPhury_Phaser3">a 2D Platformer Web Game</a> 
and 
<a href="https://github.com/twit96/TankFighter_Phaser3">a Top-Down Shooter Web Minigame</a>.

#### Business in the front(-end), party in the...
Back-end web development is the next skill I am working on. Python and I go <i>way</i> back, and my current goal is to become an experienced full-stack developer. Flask and Bootstrap, I'm coming for you first. 

#### Speaking of Python,
I also have experience with the Pandas Python Data Analysis library, with which I most recently worked on 
<a href="https://twit96.github.io/portfolio/star-wars-survey/">a data analysis project with a survey dataset</a>.
Might mess around and add 'Machine Learning', 'Data Scientist', or 'Artificial Intelligence' to my resume.

## For those who are interested,

- In my free time, I enjoy music, art, movies, coffee, and running.
- I am a dog and cat fanatic (no discrimination here).
- I studied math and computer science in college.
- I worked on a sod (grass) farm for several years before college, and
  - Yes, that means I know how to operate tractors and heavy machinery;
  - No, I (probably) don't want to change your oil.
- Finally, I just might talk your ear off about marching percussion if you let me.
