## Well <i>hello</i> world!
My name is Tyler and I am a full-stack web developer. I am proficient in front-end web 
development, and love tinkering with CSS, HTML, and JavaScript on my
<a href="https://twit96.github.io/"><b>portfolio website</b></a>. 

#### Speaking of JavaScript,
I have experience with the Phaser 3 JavaScript framework, with which I have developed 
<a href="https://github.com/twit96/PharaohsPhury_Phaser3">a 2D Platformer Web Game</a> 
and 
<a href="https://github.com/twit96/TankFighter_Phaser3">a Top-Down Shooter Web Minigame</a>.

#### Business in the front(-end), party in the...
Back-end web development is the next skill I am working on. Most recently, I developed an 
<a href="https://fall-2020.cs.utexas.edu/cs329e-bulko/wittig/P6/"><b>indie game blog</b></a> 
from the ground up using PHP and SQL, and my current goal is to become proficient in 
back-end development.

## Reach out to me!
I would love freelance or collaborative opportunities in web development, game development, and software development. I work to learn, and love to program. If you see a place for me in your project, feel free to get in touch!
